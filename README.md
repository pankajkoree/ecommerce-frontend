## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Modern UI:** Built with React, Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** Uses reusable React components for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Tailwind CSS Styling:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS for rapid styling and customization.
*   **Optimized Performance:** Leverages Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

*   **Node.js:** Version 18 or higher.  You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm:**  Usually comes with Node.js.  You can check its version with `npm -v`.
*   **Git:**  For version control.  You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

This project focuses on the front-end UI and does not include a backend API. The UI is designed to consume data from an external API. You can replace the placeholder data with your own API endpoints.

**Example Component Usage (simplified):**

```typescript jsx
// Example usage in a page component
import React from 'react';

const HomePage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Ecommerce Store</h1>
      {/*  Product Listing Component (example) */}
      {/*  <ProductList products={productsData} /> */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default HomePage;

```

## Configuration Options

The project can be configured using environment variables.  Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory to override the default settings.  Here are some configurable options:

*   **API_ENDPOINT**:  The URL of your backend API.  (Example: `API_ENDPOINT=https://your-api.com/products`)

You can access these environment variables in your Next.js code using `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`.
